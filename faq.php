               When students join IEEE, they automatically become members of the IEEE Student Branch at their university or college. Students, like professional members, automatically become members of their local IEEE Section and Region, allowing them to share technical, professional and personal interests with others in IEEE's worldwide member community. IEEE Student Branch, DA-IICT aims to provide an interactive platform for students to develop professional and technical abilities. Since the inception, it is successful in organizing various national and state events with well defined objectives.
